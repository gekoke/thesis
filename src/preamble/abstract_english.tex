The recent teachers' strike has brought under scrutiny the problem of overworking that many teachers face. We develop the web application Abi√µpetaja for generating maths tests that allows the generation of worksheets and answer keys for a subset of maths problems from the Estonian national curriculum. The application aims to decrease the work load on teachers and to simplify the creation of worksheets.

The thesis is written in Estonian and is \total{page} pages long, including 9 chapters, \total{figure} figures and \total{table} table.
