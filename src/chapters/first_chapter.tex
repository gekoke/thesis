Some basic ways to manipulate text are \textit{italics} and \textbf{bold}. One can reference Figures as well as cite references which are defined in the \textit{references.bib} file.\cite{spectre,example-reference} 

The \textit{Bibliography}, \textit{List of Figures} and \textit{List of Tables} are all automatically generated and references will be updated automatically as well. This means that if you've defined a citation but are not referencing it, it will not appear in the \textit{Bibliography}. This also means that any Figure / Table / Citations numbers are automatically updated as well. Numbering is done by order-of-appearance.
